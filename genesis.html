The education sector is growing fast. Number of NGOs/CBOs (Community-Based Organisation) is working in the field with full commitment and in relation to the same conducive environment & culture is also being created by donor/ supporter agencies.

The whole approach is swinging towards rights along with duties based approach from school social work  ( NEP 2020). In the meantime a need is coming up in terms of providing technical support (ICT) in the field of children teaching and learning research, documentation, capacity building, individual and institutional knowledge management, concept building and advocacy initiatives.

To address this need Press has been created by some very experienced persons in development sector.
Pratham Research in Education for Students’ Support (P.R.E.S.S.) was conceptualized in 2021 by a team of like-minded professionals, school leaders as an advocacy-based organization to support organizations at grass – root level as well as at global level. These professionals are not only experienced only in terms of time but also have a significant identity and clarity in their own fields.
